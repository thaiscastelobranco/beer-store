                    with a crisp and refreshing taste. This light, 
                    dry beer has pleasant malt and hop notes with a 
                    round dry finish. Regardless of the time of the year, 
                    Corona is best served ice cold, with a wedge of lime 
                    that complements and intensifies the flavour through 
                    the palate.</td>

                    and a soft dry finish. It is the perfect beer to
